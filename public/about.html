<h1>About Me!</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Leilani and I am currently learning to code! So far it's pretty fun. 
    I tend to dabble in different things I have interest in. I've a taste for a wide variety of music and food let's not forget art wether traditional or digital.
Hopefully I will do this proffessionally within a year though that may be my impatience speaking. Do enjoy the rest of your time on Earth!</p>
